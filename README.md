## Summary: 
The anaylsis revealed that most rentals are made by male users, on Thursday and Friday mornings/evenings, for between one to sixty minutes, in mid to lower Manhattan, and that the same locations that are frequent starting points are also frequent ending points. To maintian these customers, CitiBike should ensure that there is an adequate inventory in those loacations at those times/days. CititBike should work to foster more business with female customers. Further research should be done to understand why rentals are low on weekends.
